**Data & Map Overview**

Most listings were concentrated in Amsterdam in 2017. Around 1 out of every 8 listings came from pro-hosts (~1619), indicating that the platform already had a strong base of verified, experienced and reliable hosts. This implies Airbnb NL at this period was not immature — it was already trust-stable.

For customers, this means the platform was secure, trustworthy and curated enough to avoid “wild-west” risk.

For hosts, the interesting shift happened outside Amsterdam starting 2017: other regions started adopting Airbnb and they carried very high average review scores (>90%). Initially it was extremely heavily Amsterdam-centric, but the data shows a gradual decentralization.

Pricing across regions was mostly uniform except the Amstelveen zone which appears more affordable relative to Amsterdam core.

Actions to be taken

Amsterdam dominance means growth cannot scale if only Amsterdam is leveraged — platform / policy / investment should help other NL cities accelerate onboarding.

Cities near Amsterdam (Amstelveen tier) should position themselves as strategic “value hubs”.

Airbnb should leverage high review quality in non-Amsterdam regions to promote them to travelers as safe alternatives.
