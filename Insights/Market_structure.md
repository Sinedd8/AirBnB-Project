**Market Structure**

The Dutch Airbnb market at this period was primarily driven by short-term stays. Amsterdam however is the exception: it was also the dominant city for long-term stays. Most listings are entire homes / apartments, followed by private rooms that are shared with owners. Shared rooms only exist inside Amsterdam — nowhere else in the dataset.

Amsterdam is consistently occupied through the year (very few cold months), which signals extremely stable demand.

This supports a strategic direction: increasing the supply of long-term listings, especially in or near Amsterdam, where there is heavy presence of international workers and students who require stable housing. Other regions should convert into more long-term listings as well, but remain more affordable to compensate for the geographic distance from the primary economic hub.

Actions to be taken

Incentivize / onboard more long-term listings inside Amsterdam & near Amsterdam rings.

Create value positioning for secondary cities as long-term affordable escape valves for housing pressure.

Market and partner with student mobility / expat agencies in NL — long-term segment fits this perfectly.
