**Other interesting insights**

The most expensive tourist listing was €999/night — vs the most expensive long-term listing at €300/night.
Even back then (pre 2017), €300 for a monthly-type stay is extremely competitive value.

This expensive tourist listing didn’t even check intuition boxes:

no AC

yes kitchen

not a pro-host

entire home/apartment

→ this shows price is not mechanically driven by these typical amenity or host status signals. Location / scarcity / timing clearly dominates price elasticity for tourist weekender Airbnb demand.

On the bottom end: the lowest review scored listings were tourist based — one entire apartment and one private room — even one with a private kitchen still performed badly.

→ amenities do not inherently save a bad guest experience.
Experience > inventory.

Actions to be taken

do not rely on “being a pro host” nor AC nor any single amenity as a pricing lever — narrative + positioning + location beats checkboxes.

for new hosts: prioritize tourist-stay micro differentiation (story, feature photos, quality positioning) — not piling amenities.

value hosts with long-term strategy: keep pricing fair → you gain review stability and better review distribution curve long term.

These insight fragments are extremely good storyline slides for a short “value vs feature” tradeoff narration in the final presentation.
