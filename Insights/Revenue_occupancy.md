**Revenue and Occupancy**

Total revenue from 2008-09-24 → 2017-04-02 is €557.15M.
Average occupancy rate is 0.77 → listings were taken / booked ~77% of the time.
This alone proves the model in NL works extremely well — sustained high utilization + sustained high monetization.
Host insight
Centrum Oost & Centrum West outperform consistently. Even listings with mediocre review scores (60 / 80 region) still outperform in revenue — over €40k avg vs the global neighborhood mean of €36.7k.
Translation → location > ratings in profitability.
For a host, this means: positioning is more powerful than marginal rating optimization.
Customer insight
Best value pick = Duivendrecht.
€47/night with review score 93 + 12 min from Amsterdam Centrum (2-5 EUR train ride).
Customers can arbitrage price → review → location by stepping slightly outside centre without losing much experience value.
Actions to be taken


Host supply in Centrum West / Oost should be strategically expanded → proven highest commercial return.


Airbnb should purposely market “outer ring arbitrage zones” (like Duivendrecht) — this improves access, reduces housing pressure in centrum and increases overall conversion.
