**Reviews + Amenities**

Average review rating overall is 93.90 → Netherlands Airbnb listings generally score extremely high on guest satisfaction.
Having WiFi, AC or Kitchen doesn’t significantly shift review scores.
Example: no-WiFi listings scoring slightly higher is not real signal — it’s purely because that subset is too tiny and extremely skewed. No normal distribution → cannot generalize.
Where amenities matter more = price positioning.


WiFi adds ~€3/night → not material enough to influence choice


Kitchen adds ~€40/night → this matches business reality: kitchen usually implies a full space / bigger unit not just a room


→ kitchen is the differentiator, not the connectivity features.
Actions to be taken


Airbnb should prioritize amenity tagging + search ranking based on real value drivers (kitchen, space) not superficial flags (wifi).


Host playbook: invest in kitchen upgrade before AC/Wifi gimmicks → higher return per night and better positioning for longer stays.
