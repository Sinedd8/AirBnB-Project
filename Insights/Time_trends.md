**Time Trends**

Amsterdam maintains steady, year-round revenue — strong indication of mature and sustained market demand.
Listings there cater both tourists (short-term) and residents/students/workers (long-term), resulting in minimal seasonal volatility.

A distinct September spike in Haarlem aligns perfectly with the academic cycle — students securing temporary housing when university terms begin.

Other Dutch cities show revenue upticks from mid-February to April 2017, which corresponds with the Airbnb adoption phase — when hosts from those regions began listing properties.

Actions to be taken

For Airbnb: target emerging cities with host onboarding campaigns — they’re entering growth phase similar to Amsterdam’s early years.

For hosts: optimize seasonal pricing for September–October in Haarlem and other student-heavy cities.

For policymakers: promote long-term rental support programs through Airbnb partnerships to mitigate housing strain around Amsterdam while decentralizing demand.
