**Host Behaviour**
Average host rating is 85.22% — which is genuinely strong performance. NL hosts overall deliver good / reliable experience.
There is a visible drop of ~5% in average rating among hosts who have many listings. But this cannot be claimed causally. When looking at scatter variance plots, the distribution is too wide — not a downward monotonic pattern. Therefore: more listings does not automatically mean worse guest experience.
We also do not observe a correlation between minimum rating and number of listings. This means scaling hosting activity in NL is not inherently degrading experience quality.
Actions to be taken


Encourage scaling up host supply — because NL can scale host count without significantly degrading review performance.


Offer tooling support for high-listing hosts (smart automated comms, cleaning coordination, calendar sync) to protect ratings at scale.


Do not restrict listing growth based purely on review score fear — data does not justify that constraint.
