**Pricing Insights**

Most listings price between €100–€200 per night, which aligns with Amsterdam being one of the most expensive European cities. Median and mean price are close, meaning prices are generally well behaved — but the mean being slightly higher reveals extreme outliers (like the €999/night listing) pulling the average upward without actually delivering occupancy or long-term revenue benefit.

This indicates the market naturally price stabilizes around mid-tier. The upper extreme tier does not translate to superior performance.

For hosts:
staying inside the €100–€200 band is the strategically optimal positioning. That is where the majority of bookings occur, and psychologically where guests default to. Going significantly above that price does not necessarily increase yearly profitability.

For customers:
long term booking is extremely financially smart here. Monthly AirBnB bookings can go as low as -62% discount vs normal nightly pricing. AirBnB in this period was openly acting like a pressure release valve to NL housing shortages — but customers who understand this pricing strategy benefit the most.

Actions to be taken

Educate hosts to target the €100–€200 range to maximize utilization and stable revenue.

Marketing campaigns to position “long stay = best value” towards expats / students / temp workers.

Introduce dynamic range pricing recommendations to hosts based on the mid-band cluster — not the highest band outliers.
