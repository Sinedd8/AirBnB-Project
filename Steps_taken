Steps Taken ‚Äî SQL to Power BI

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Import & Exploration

Imported the raw InsideAirbnb dataset (airbnbnl_raw) into PostgreSQL (~2GB trimmed to Netherlands).

Verified table structure with information_schema.columns and checked data sanity using COUNT(*), LIMIT 5, and JSON-based NULL profiling.

Purpose: confirm schema integrity and detect missing / malformed values before cleaning.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Normalization

Created v_airbnb_clean view using CAST, REGEXP_REPLACE, TRIM, LOWER, COALESCE, and NULLIF.

Converted text-based numerics (price, fees, availability) into numeric types and harmonized EU/US separators.

Purpose: make messy text data queryable and ready for type-safe analysis.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Deduplication

Built v_airbnb_latest using ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY listing_id ORDER BY last_scraped DESC) to keep the newest listing snapshot.

Purpose: ensure a one-row-per-listing structure for BI integration.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Dimensional Modeling

Created dimensions for context and join stability:

dim_host: host tenure, listing count, pro-host flag.

dim_location: city and neighbourhood centroids for mapping.

dim_calendar_month: generated month scaffold using generate_series.

Purpose: enable clean star-schema joins and aggregations in Power BI.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering

Built v_fact_features_joined combining facts with dimensions.

Engineered columns:

occupancy_proxy, booked_nights_proxy, revenue_proxy

Stay classification (tourist vs long_term)

Amenity flags (Wi-Fi, kitchen, AC) from text using ILIKE and regex.

Purpose: pre-compute business-ready KPIs directly in SQL.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Aggregations & Analytics

Created analytic views for advanced insights:

v_city_roomtype_summary ‚Üí city/room-type comparisons

v_city_price_quantiles ‚Üí medians via PERCENTILE_CONT

v_corr_snaps ‚Üí correlations via CORR()

v_top5_price_per_city ‚Üí window-function ranking

Purpose: demonstrate analytical fluency beyond simple aggregates.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Data Quality & Set Operations

Created v_qc_setops using INTERSECT and EXCEPT to check logic mismatches (e.g., pro-host vs host count, stay type vs nights).

Purpose: validate the accuracy and internal consistency of the dataset.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Export for Power BI

Connected Power BI directly to the analytics schema in PostgreSQL.

Imported all key views (v_fact_features_joined, dims, QC).

Verified schema joins (star-schema structure: 1 fact ‚Üí 3 dims).

Purpose: provide a stable data model for analysis and visuals.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Power BI Modeling & Visualization

Created relationships manually where needed (city_key, host_id, month_key).

Added DAX measures for totals, averages, occupancy %, and review ratios.

Built multi-page dashboard:

Market Overview

Pricing Insights

Host & Occupancy

Reviews & Amenities

Trends Over Time

QC / Data Integrity

üîü Final Output

Delivered an interactive Power BI dashboard using:

Map, bar, line, scatter, pie, matrix, word cloud, and KPI visuals.

Bookmarks, drill-through pages, and Q&A exploration.

Purpose: end-to-end demonstration of SQL + BI proficiency, from raw data to polished insights.
