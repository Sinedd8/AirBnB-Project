# AirBnB-Project
Project made to showcase SQL and mainly PowerBI skills in a short timeframe (12 hours of work). The goal was to find insights, for both customers and AirBnB owners.

AI was used to generate the git words and presentation but the visualisations and Loom videos were fully mine.

üè° Airbnb Data Analytics Dashboard (SQL + Power BI)

**Project Overview**

This project explores the Airbnb market using SQL for data preparation and modeling and Power BI for interactive visualization.
The dataset (from Kaggle: Airbnb Listings) covers thousands of listings across the Netherlands, primarily Amsterdam.

The goal was to design a complete BI workflow:

Clean and transform raw Airbnb data in PostgreSQL

Build dimensional models and feature-engineered facts

Visualize insights in Power BI using diverse chart types

Create a business-ready dashboard suitable for executive and analytical use

**I wanted to emphasise that this was a 2-day project. (10-12 hours of work). I wanted to showcase my time efficiency.**

The quality of the analysis is not so perfect, as it was mostly used to showcase the various skills possible in (basic) PowerBI.
