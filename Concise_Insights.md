## Business Insights Summary

### Data + Map Overview
Netherlands Airbnb was already heavily Amsterdam-centric in 2017 (~80% of listings). ~1/8 listings are from pro hosts → strong reliability + professional inventory foundation.

### Market Structure
NL is mostly a short-term tourism market. Amsterdam is the only region with meaningful shared room supply. Long-term demand exists mainly around Amsterdam (students + internationals). This indicates opportunity for more long-term stock outside Amsterdam at slightly lower price points.

### Pricing Insights
Typical price lands between €100 and €200 / night. Median ≈ Mean → mostly balanced pricing structure. Extreme outliers exist (max €999) but they are not revenue leaders. Psychological sweet spot for hosts remains €100–€200.

### Host Behaviour
NL has genuinely good host quality (avg rating ~85%). Higher listing portfolio doesn’t systematically lower review scores — no clear negative correlation.

### Revenue + Occupancy
Total revenue (period 2008→2017) ≈ €557M. Occupancy ~77% average. Centrum Oost/West listings remain consistently profitable even with imperfect reviews → location premium dominates.

### Reviews + Amenities
Avg review ~94. WiFi ≈ no pricing premium. Kitchen → ~€40 premium (makes sense: real apartment space). Amenities influence price more than rating.

### Time Trends
Amsterdam stays in demand all year. Haarlem spikes around September (student cycle). Regional listings outside Amsterdam mostly boot up late (2017 entry effect).

### Misc Deep Cuts
Tourist max price €999, long-term max ~€300. Some “no AC but entire home” were extremely high priced — location + uniqueness > amenity set.



## Recommended actions

- Increase long-term supply **near** Amsterdam (Amstel / Amstelveen / Haarlem) to absorb student + expat demand spillover.
- Hosts should anchor price around €100–€200 and differentiate through space/kitchen rather than AC or micro-amenities.
- Airbnb should segment marketing for Haarlem in September → high seasonal conversion window.
- Pro host onboarding should target non-Amsterdam urban areas to raise supply diversity.
