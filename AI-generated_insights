💡 Key Insights
👥 1. For Customers (Travelers)

Amsterdam dominates the market, accounting for ~95% of listings — mostly entire apartments aimed at tourists.

Top amenities that correlate with higher review scores are Wi-Fi, Kitchen, and AC, showing clear guest preference for comfort and convenience.

Seasonality: Occupancy peaks between May–August, while prices remain stable, meaning earlier bookings in Q2 give best value.

🏡 2. For Hosts (Property Owners)

High competition in Amsterdam’s center – to stand out, focus on amenities and review quality rather than underpricing.

Pro hosts (~11%) manage most listings and achieve higher review scores (≈94+) due to experience, verified profiles, and consistency.

Revenue correlation: Review scores and occupancy are positively correlated — well-rated listings earn up to 2× higher revenue proxies.

Neighbourhood insights: Zuid and Centrum-Oost show higher willingness to pay (avg. €175–180) compared to Noord-West (€82).
